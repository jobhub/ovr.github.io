Some Days ago I decided that need to create english version because a big part of my blog visitors are native english speakers. 
It is a big problem when someone tried to translate my articles from russian language intro english by google translate or something else, but I'll fix it.

#What is my blog about?

Most of all articles I will write about Zephir, Phalcon, high performance tune and servers administration.

#Upcomming articles

- 128 Days on github
- How to setup your own dns servers
- Zephir language vs PHP-CPP

Will see you next time on new articles, good buy :)
