Some Days ago I decided that need to create english version because a big part of my blog visitors are native english speakers. 
So i think it is a big problem when someone visitors tried to translate my blog from russian language intro english by google translate.

#What is my blog about?

Most of all articles I will write about Zephir, Phalcon, high performance tune and servers administration.

#Upcomming articles

- 128 Days on github
- How to setup your own dns servers
- Zephir would be better then PHP-CPP

Will see you next time on new articles, good buy :)
